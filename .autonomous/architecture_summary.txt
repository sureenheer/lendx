LENDX AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY ARCHITECTURE - IMPLEMENTATION READY
====================================================================

COMPLETED: 2025-10-26
SYSTEM ARCHITECT: Complete architecture design and documentation

DELIVERABLES CREATED:
--------------------

1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):
   - ADR-001: Authentication Method Selection (JWT + wallet signatures)
   - ADR-002: RLS vs Application-Level Authorization (layered approach)
   - ADR-003: Wallet Key Management Strategy (Vault/KMS)
   - ADR-004: Session Management Approach (24h sliding sessions)

2. Implementation Guides:
   - AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md (40KB) - Complete auth architecture
   - RLS_POLICIES.md (24KB) - Production-ready SQL policies
   - SECURITY_ROADMAP.md (21KB) - 3-week implementation plan
   - README.md - Navigation and quick start guide

ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY:
--------------------

Authentication: JWT tokens issued after wallet signature verification
- User signs challenge with XRPL wallet (via Xumm)
- Backend verifies signature, issues JWT (24h expiration)
- Token stored in localStorage, included in all requests
- Sliding sessions: auto-refresh if < 1h to expiry
- Logout revokes token via Redis blocklist

Authorization: Layered (RLS + Application)
- RLS policies enforce data access at database level
- Application layer adds UX improvements and complex logic
- Service role bypasses RLS for admin operations

Security Features:
- Rate limiting (5/min challenge, 10/min login)
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Audit logging (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Token revocation (Redis blocklist with TTL)
- Secrets management (Vault → KMS migration path)

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:
---------------------

Phase 1 (Week 1): Basic Authentication
- JWT generation/verification
- Challenge generation/storage (Redis)
- XRPL signature verification
- Auth endpoints + FastAPI dependencies
- Frontend wallet integration
- Protected endpoints require auth

Phase 2 (Week 2): Authorization & Security
- Enable RLS on all tables
- Apply RLS policies (19 policies total)
- Token blocklist (logout)
- Sliding sessions (token refresh)
- Rate limiting + security headers
- Audit logging

Phase 3 (Week 3): Testing & Production
- Automated tests (90%+ coverage)
- Security tests + RLS tests
- Monitoring and alerts
- Documentation complete
- Production deployment

KEY DECISIONS:
-------------

✅ JWT with wallet signatures (not pure wallet auth, not OAuth)
   Reason: Best UX + security for blockchain identity

✅ RLS + application-level authorization (not RLS-only, not app-only)
   Reason: Defense in depth with good DX

✅ 24-hour sliding sessions (not short-lived, not long-lived)
   Reason: Balance security vs UX

✅ Redis blocklist for revocation (not stateless JWT)
   Reason: Enables logout functionality

✅ Users control private keys (backend never sees them)
   Reason: Decentralization principle

✅ Service wallet in Vault/KMS (not environment variables)
   Reason: Production security compliance

HANDOFF TO ENGINEERS:
--------------------

Backend Team:
1. Start with backend/docs/README.md
2. Follow SECURITY_ROADMAP.md Phase 1 (Week 1)
3. Implement files in backend/auth/ directory
4. Reference AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md for details
5. Use RLS_POLICIES.md for database migration

Frontend Team:
1. Read AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md "Frontend Integration" section
2. Implement Zustand auth store (frontend/lib/auth/store.ts)
3. Update wallet connection flow to include challenge signing
4. Create API client with auto token refresh
5. Add ProtectedRoute wrapper component

DevOps Team:
1. Set up Redis instance (development + production)
2. Configure secrets management (Vault initially)
3. Set up monitoring for auth metrics
4. Configure security headers in load balancer
5. Plan KMS migration for production

NEXT STEPS:
----------

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
- Review architecture with team (1h meeting)
- Set up development environment (Redis, dependencies)
- Begin Phase 1 implementation (Week 1 tasks)
- Schedule security review for end of Week 2

WEEK 1 GOAL:
- Users can login via wallet signature
- JWT tokens issued and verified
- Protected endpoints require authentication
- Frontend integrates with auth system

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
----------------

Week 1: ✅ Login working end-to-end
Week 2: ✅ RLS enabled, data protected
Week 3: ✅ Production-ready with tests

Overall:
- Zero unauthorized data access
- < 2% login failure rate
- 90%+ test coverage
- > 99.9% uptime
