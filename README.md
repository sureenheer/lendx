## About the Project

LendX is a decentralized lending platform that leverages the XRP Ledger to create a trustless, efficient marketplace for peer-to-peer lending. By combining blockchain technology with modern UX design, we're making financial services accessible to underserved populations in emerging markets.

**Key Benefits:**

- Transaction fees of fractions of a cent
- Trustless loan agreements secured by blockchain
- Native wallet integration for seamless user experience
- Verifiable credentials for identity and reputation
- Real-time settlement with instant confirmation

---

## Inspiration

Financial inclusion remains one of the world's greatest challenges. Traditional banking systems fail to serve billions of people, particularly in emerging markets. We were inspired by the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) to democratize access to credit for small business owners and entrepreneurs in regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

**The Problem:**
- 1.7 billion adults globally remain unbanked
- Traditional credit scoring excludes individuals without formal financial history
- High banking fees make microlending economically unviable
- Cross-border lending is prohibitively expensive and slow

**Our Solution:**

LendX leverages XRPL's low transaction costs (fractions of a cent) and fast settlement times (3-5 seconds) to make microlending economically viable at scale.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- Git

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sureenheer/lendx.git
cd lendx

# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Auth0 and XRPL configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
# From project root
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run tests
pytest

# Start FastAPI server
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload
```

## Usage

### Frontend Application

The LendX frontend provides two main interfaces:

1. **Landing Page** (`/`): Welcome page with Auth0 login/signup
2. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Main application with dual-role interface

**Lender Dashboard:**
- Create lending pools with custom rates and terms
- View pool statistics and available liquidity
- Approve/reject loan requests
- Withdraw funds from pools

**Borrower Dashboard:**
- Browse available lending pools
- Apply for loans with purpose descriptions
- Track loan status and repayment schedules
- Make loan payments

### Python XRPL Client Library

#### Basic Connection and Transactions

```python
from backend.xrpl_client import connect, submit_and_wait
from xrpl.wallet import Wallet

# Connect to XRPL network
client = connect('testnet')  # or 'mainnet'

# Create a wallet
wallet = Wallet.create()

# Submit a payment transaction
tx = {
    "TransactionType": "Payment",
    "Account": wallet.address,
    "Destination": "rDestinationAddress",
    "Amount": "1000000"  # 1 XRP in drops
}
result = submit_and_wait(client, tx, wallet)
```

#### Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) Operations

```python
from backend.xrpl_client import create_issuance, mint_to_holder, get_mpt_balance

# Create MPT issuance for loan representation
issuance_id = create_issuance(client, issuer_wallet, "LOAN", "LendX Loan Token")

# Mint tokens to represent loan amount
tx_hash = mint_to_holder(client, issuer_wallet, borrower_address, 100.0, issuance_id)

# Check token balance
balance = get_mpt_balance(client, borrower_address, issuance_id)
```

#### Escrow Operations for Loan Security

```python
from backend.xrpl_client import create_deposit_escrow, finish_escrow

# Create escrow for loan collateral
sequence = create_deposit_escrow(client, borrower_wallet, 1000000, lender_address)

# Release escrow when loan is repaid
tx_hash = finish_escrow(client, lender_wallet, borrower_address, sequence)
```

#### Multi-Signature Account Management

```python
from backend.xrpl_client import setup_multisig_account, create_multisig_tx

# Setup multisig account for institutional lending
signers = ["rAddress1", "rAddress2", "rAddress3"]
tx_hash = setup_multisig_account(client, master_wallet, signers, threshold=2)

# Create multi-signed transaction
multisig_blob = create_multisig_tx(tx_json, [wallet1, wallet2])
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:

```env
# Auth0 Configuration
AUTH0_SECRET='use [openssl rand -hex 32] to generate a 32 bytes value'
AUTH0_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL='https://your-tenant.auth0.com'
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='your_auth0_client_id'
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='your_auth0_client_secret'

# XRPL Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_XRPL_NETWORK=testnet  # or mainnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_XRPL_WEBSOCKET=wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233

# Optional: Xumm Wallet Integration (legacy)
NEXT_PUBLIC_XAMAN_API_KEY=your_xaman_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_XAMAN_API_SECRET=your_xaman_secret
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run Python backend tests
pytest

# Run frontend linting
cd frontend
npm run lint

# Build frontend for production
npm run build
```
